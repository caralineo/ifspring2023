            <li>My name is Caraline. I am a junior majoring in design with minors in marketing and psychology.</li>
            <li>I am from New York and have always had an interest in design in general. I've never taken any type of coding class, so I figured Interaction Foundations would be a great way to expose me to code a bit, while still having design elements involved.</li>
            <li>I have absolutely no experience with HTML/CSS/JS.</li>
            <li>I hope to learn the key building blocks of a website, and features to keep in mind while designing one.</li>
            <li>I expect that designing for the screen will encompass thinking more about the user experience with navigation, and how one element will flow to the next for ease of the user.</li>
            <li>https://www.nike.com This website exemplifies effective design because they have a good balance between pictures and type, so the user gets a sense of their style on the homepage while also being able to explore the products further by clicking on sections. Furthermore, Nike's logo is clearly shown, but does not overwhelm the user.</li>
            <li>https://shop.lululemon.com This website exemplifies effective communication because they have clear headings and sections that are varied based on font size and color.</li>
            <li>https://www.mms.com/en-us/ This website works well because it has a fun and happy vibe, which aligns with M&M's and the sense you get while eating candy. Specifically, I think the icons at the top that are labeled are effective to navigate the website while also having a cool design component.</li>
