   <p>
    <a href="https://www.epicurious.com/"> epicurious.com</a>
    The homepage of this website has a clear search filter that allows the user to immediately find recipes. The website also encompasses a type of blog for food, which makes the website more interactive, and allows the user to use it for more than just recipes. The articles are written by multiple authors and include kitchen tricks, cooking hacks, and other useful food info.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/"> bonappetit.com</a> 
    I like how this website has tags on their recipe's pictures regarding the skill level that the recipe is. Also, the Bon Appetit logo enlarges when you scroll up on the page, which is a nice touch because it emphasizes their logo and the fact that these recipes will provide the person with a good meal. 
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/"> simplyrecipes.com</a>
    The homepage is split so there is one recipe largely shown in a single picture on the left side, while the right side showcases multiple recipes with the ability to scroll. I like how each recipe gives a description and a brief backstory as to why this recipe is good. I also think having pictures throughout the recipe showing the steps is helpful.

    I like the fonts used by The New Yorker. They provide the viewer with the ability to clearly distinguish different sections and titles. I also like how the top logo gets bigger and smaller depending on which way the user is scrolling.
    <br>
    <a href="https://makerny.com/">makerny.com</a>
    This website uses white space effectively to evoke a calm aesthetic. I like how the white space also allows the viewer to focus directly on one thing at a time that is presented on the screen.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.billabong.com/">billabong.com</a> 
    This website's use of text over images is effective on the homepage and has good contrast. I think there is a good balance between imagery, white space, and text. I also think this website uses the hierarchy of text well for each item, so the details are still shown (price, colors, etc.), but the viewer's eyes first go to the title of the product.
