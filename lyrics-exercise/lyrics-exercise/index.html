                Jersey made <br>
                I was born and raised in the Garden State and my mama prayed <br>
                I would trust in God, growin' up is hard, so I made mistakes <br>
                In the DMV, gettin' my degree, it was fun and games <br>
                Before the drinkin' age (oh) <br>
           </p>

            <p>
                I tried to fit in but didn't, I'm different, yeah, I know (know) <br>
                The houses I stayed in were great but they never felt like home (so) <br>
            </p>

           <p>
                I'm going cross country <br>
                I won't stop running 'til I find where I belong <br>
                I'm going cross country <br>
                Know they might judge me, I ain't gotta prove 'em wrong <br>
                'Cause I know it's okay to be in my own lane <br>
                When I'm doing what they said can't be done <br>
                I'm going cross country <br>
                I won't stop running 'til I find where I belong <br>
                (Where I belong) <br>
           </p>
    
           <p>
                Went to ATL <br>
                Where the nights are long, with a thousand songs that would never sell <br>
                'Til I dropped the bomb that would put me on, did it by myself <br>
                Uh, heard the living's good out in Hollywood, thought I might as well <br>
                Uh, and I signed a deal (oh) <br>
           </p>
            
    
           <p>
